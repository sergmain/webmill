In summary, you need to modify Tomcat's server.xml (located in the conf
directory) to add the attribute emptySessionPath="true" to the 
non-SSL HTTP/1.1 <Connector> descriptor:

    <!-- Define a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8080 -->
    <Connector port="8080"
               maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
               enableLookups="false" redirectPort="8443" acceptCount="100"
               connectionTimeout="20000" disableUploadTimeout="true" 
               emptySessionPath="true" /> 



Note that server.xml can sometimes be picky about tabs and spaces in the 
<Connector/> definition.  If you have made the above modification and still
can't get download to work, put emptySessionPath on the same line as 
disableUploadTimeout
