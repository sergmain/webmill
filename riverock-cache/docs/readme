Main goal of project js-cache is support synchronized data which store in relational DB 
with data which in cache. For solve this task project divided in two parts - first part 
is simple implementation of cache with support TTL, hit-counter and second is synchronization classes. 
For sync data all requests to JDBC driver are registered in sync factory. Internal SQL parser
decide which type of DML is requested and extract names of tables which used in this query.
On commit sync factory removed datas from cache which are deprecated.
for SQL parser we use ANTLR.
