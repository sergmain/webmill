The jar files in this directories are organized according to following principles:

lib/runtime/
    for a (small) ant runtime.
    This is used by both developers and webtest users.
    The files are referenced from the startup scripts (webtest, webtest.bat)
lib/build/
    for jar files that belongs to a developer's run-time but not to an end-user's runtime.
    The files are referenced from the startup scripts (webtest.sh, webtets.cmd), if absolutely necessary,
    or from ant's build.xml.
lib/base/
    for the original versions of 3rd party libraries that need patching.
    In the best case, this directory may be empty.
lib/optional/
    for 3rd party libraries that may be omitted inspecial circumstances, such as the groovy thing.
lib/
    for all the libraries that a webtest user needs
